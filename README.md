## Foto Finder

This project was a final solo project for Mod 1 at Turing. Solidify and demonstrate your use of:
semantic HTML
clean & organized CSS styles
DRY JavaScript
localStorage to persist data
Iterate through/filter dom elements using for loops/array prototype methods
Understands the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX

It was designed as a way for us to demonstrate our command of specific javascript processes, html, and css. The goal was to build a responsive client-side application with good user feedback, and understand how to implement client-side data persistence using local storage, separate data (using a class) and dom models, data-* attributes, iterate over dom elements in order to filter what is being displayed, and craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness.

FotoFider allows a user to create a "photo" with a title and caption, click the heart icon to save a targeted photo as a "favorite", click the trash icon to delete a targeted photo, update photos after they've been added, filter photos by their "favorite" status, and search for photos in the search bar. Photos (as well as any changes to that photo) are saved to local storage and persist on the DOM on pageload. Deleted items are removed from both the DOM and local storage.
